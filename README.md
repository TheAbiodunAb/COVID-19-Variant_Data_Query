# COVID-19-Variant_Data_Query
The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying ​the prevalence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants by analysing ​CDPH Genomic Surveillance Data and ​CalREDIE, CDPH's communicable disease reporting and surveillance system. Viruses mutate into new strains or variants over time. Some variants emerge and then disappear. Other variants become common and circulate for a long time. Several specialized laboratories state-wide sequence the genomes of a fraction of all positive COVID-19 tests to determine which variants are circulating. Sequencing and reporting of variant results takes several days after a test is identified as a positive for COVID-19. Not all ​viruses from positive COVID-19 tests are ​sequenced. Knowing what variants are circulating in California informs public health and clinical action.


Questions:

-- What are the Variants
-- Total number of the Variants
-- Grand Total of 'Variant' within 2021 - 2023 
-- What are the variants that emerge and then disappear
-- Trend of disappearing from 2021 to 2023
